# README

The purpose of this **practice repository** is to get comfortable using the front end skills we've learned so far. Also to gain experience using & collaborating with **git** and the **GitHub** online repository service. If you don't have one already, please [create a GitHub account](http://www.github.com) as it is required to contribute to the project.
> :warning: **IMPORTANT: Please fork this repository to _your_ account and work as you would locally from there**

## Website Ideas
This is short list of ideas that are on the table. Feel free to add more, but let's try to wrap up the concept in a week. **near 3/10**

* a site compiling links, tutorials, and articles shared in the **Udacity Discussion Forums**? This would ultimately be a site where the following class could visit and learn the best resources on how to tackle the challenge lessons from the course - anything that has helped us and others (git/Github links, JavaScript articles, motivational tips, etc.) towards moving on to the *Front End Nanodegree* course.

* a mock online storefront

* mock social network main page

We can think about and expand on these concepts a little more, **1 week** should be plenty of time to come up with a fun, quick, and easy project. My pick is the Udacity resources!

## Learning Git and Github 
If you haven't already, please begin learning **the fundamentals of git** and **collaborating on GitHub**. Most of the fundamental learning will involve using git on your local machine and we will be using GitHub's collaborative features to build together.

> #### This is necessary, especially if you plan to contribute code to the project.


### Git and GitHub Learning Resources
Here's some links that were passed around in the forums that I believe are some of the best and I added some that really got me on track with making pull requests and stuff (**SPOILER**: it's easy!).

* [Udacity Course: How To Use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) *(course)*

## Current Group Tasks and Deadlines

* We have **1 week** *(by March 10th or 11th)* to [choose a team](#project-team-sign-up) to contribute with. How would you like to contribute? **More details below.**

* Take as much time as you need to understand the basics of git and collaborating, but I'm hoping in about a week or so we will
	* Know and understand the fundamentals of git and collaborating on GitHub
	* Establish main idea for website
	* Create somewhat of an initial layout/design of the main page

## Project Goals
* Learn git/GitHub & web development in a "remote group environment"
* Create a simple project; **1-2 pages** *w/ room to expand*
* Practice what we've learned so far in the course
* Be challenged! Not overwhelmed
* Work in small teams, hoping everyone will have a meaningful role


## Project Team Sign Up
 
> **Instruction:** Let's keep this process simple!
> 
>The only change you will be making for now is adding your name to whichever team you'd like to contribute with using the format below. Add your name to a team  and push your changes to the main repo's **dev** branch, creating a pull request. Once approved, the changes will be merged

**This syntax creates a table in Markdown, all you have to do is edit/insert your information like so:**

```
Name         | Disc Forum @ | Slack @ | Link (optional)
-----        | -----        | -----   | -----
(your name)  | (your @)     | your @  | optional link
```
 You'll get it when you see how others have done it. If not, just ask someone. This list will determine who the contributors are for this project. Adding your name to a table is as easy as separating your info with the **pipe** character like this:
 
```name | disc forum name | slack name | (optional link) ```


>#### You can be on more than one team, just make sure there are enough duties for everyone to contribute meaningfully.
