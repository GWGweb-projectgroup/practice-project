# Welcome!

Welcome to the **GWGweb-projectgroup** _practice project_ repository!

The purpose of this **practice repository** is to get comfortable using the front end skills we've learned so far. Also to gain experience using & collaborating with **git** and the **GitHub** online repository service. If you don't have one already, please [create a GitHub account](http://www.github.com) as it is required to contribute to the project.

:warning: **IMPORTANT: Please fork this repository to _your_ account and work as you would locally from there.** Please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/GWGweb-projectgroup/practice-project/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more information.

## Progress
This section will be updated so that any newcomers can quickly view the progress of our project!

## Learning Git and Github
If you haven't already, please begin learning **the fundamentals of git** and **collaborating on GitHub**. Most of the fundamental learning will involve using git on your local machine and we will be using GitHub's collaborative features to build together.

> #### This is necessary, especially if you plan to contribute code to the project.


### Git and GitHub Learning Resources
Here's some links that were passed around in the forums that I believe are some of the best and I added some that really got me on track with making pull requests and stuff (**SPOILER**: it's easy!).

* [Udacity Course: How To Use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) *(course)*

## Current Group Tasks and Deadlines

* We have **1 week** *(by March 10th or 11th)* to [choose a team](#project-team-sign-up) to contribute with. How would you like to contribute? **More details below.**

* Take as much time as you need to understand the basics of git and collaborating, but I'm hoping in about a week or so we will
	* Know and understand the fundamentals of git and collaborating on GitHub
	* Establish main idea for website
	* Create somewhat of an initial layout/design of the main page

## Project Goals
* Learn git/GitHub & web development in a "remote group environment"
* Create a simple project; **1-2 pages** *w/ room to expand*
* Practice what we've learned so far in the course
* Be challenged! Not overwhelmed
* Work in small teams, hoping everyone will have a meaningful role


## Project Team Sign Up

> **Instruction:** Let's keep this process simple!
>
>The only change you will be making for now is adding your name to whichever team you'd like to contribute with using the format below. Add your name to a team  and push your changes to the main repo's **dev** branch, creating a pull request. Once approved, the changes will be merged

**This syntax creates a table in Markdown, all you have to do is edit/insert your information like so:**

```
Name         | Disc Forum @ | Slack @ | Link (optional)
-----        | -----        | -----   | -----
(your name)  | (your @)     | your @  | optional link
```
 You'll get it when you see how others have done it. If not, just ask someone. This list will determine who the contributors are for this project. Adding your name to a table is as easy as separating your info with the **pipe** character like this:

```name | disc forum name | slack name | (optional link) ```


>#### You can be on more than one team, just make sure there are enough duties for everyone to contribute meaningfully.
